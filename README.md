# Varnish
WPF File Encryptor

## Considerations
1. The password security is poor.  The plain text password is assigned to a variable and passed to a service.

## To Do
- [ ] Seperate commands from the view models
- [ ] Add unit tests.
- [ ] Make async.
- [ ] Fix view models and services to use either a secure string or the encrypted hash.
