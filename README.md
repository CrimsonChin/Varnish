# Varnish
WPF File Encryptor and encrypted image viewer using PRISM.

Points of Interest
The password security is poor.  The plain text password is assigned to a variable and passed to a service.
PRISM is not really used extensively enough to warrent its inclusion.
There are no unit tests.
Namespaces need addressing.
